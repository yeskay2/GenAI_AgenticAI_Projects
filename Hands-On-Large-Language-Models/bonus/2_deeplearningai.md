## What you'll learn

* Gain an understanding of the key components of transformers, including tokenization, embeddings, self-attention, and transformer blocks, to build a strong technical foundation.
* Understand recent transformer improvements to the attention mechanism such as KV cache, multi-query attention, grouped query attention, and sparse attention.
* Compare tokenization strategies used in modern LLMS and explore transformers in the Hugging Face Transformers library.
