# Bonus Material

With the incredible growth of Language AI in recent years, capturing everything in a single book (even with 400 pages!) 
is near impossible. That does not mean one should not try and come up with a creative solution to this problem of size and growth.

We decided to cover the fundamentals of LLMs in the book which left us with an interesting opportunity. 
Using the book as a starting point, we could continue creating visual/illustrative content that explore 
certain topics in-depth that could not be covered that way in the book.

<p align="center"><i>All bonus materials enhance the book through the same <b>visual</b> and <b>illustrative</b> style of the book</i></p>

After reading the book, you are ready to go through these more complex topics through highly visual, detailed, and in-depth guides. Because you are already familiar with our illustrative styles, reading through these advanced concepts should be a breeze!
