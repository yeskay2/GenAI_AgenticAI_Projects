    "# LangSmith Tutorial: Adding Observability to AI Systems with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to add observability to AI systems using LangSmith and LangGraph. While building AI applications has become more accessible, understanding how they make decisions and monitoring their behavior in real-world usage remains challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Observability Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Most AI applications work well in demonstrations but become difficult to debug and optimize when deployed. Without visibility into the decision-making process, teams struggle with fundamental questions: Why did the AI choose this particular response? Which parts of the system are slow or expensive? How can we systematically improve performance based on real usage patterns? What trajectories of tools are most effective? Which of these trajectories are the most effective, repetitive and cost effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of observability as adding a \"flight recorder\" to your AI system. Just as airlines use black boxes to understand what happened during flights, LangSmith captures every decision, timing, and data flow in your AI system. This transforms AI development from guesswork into engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you will understand how to instrument AI systems for transparency and observability. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a simple research assistant using LangGraph that demonstrates key observability patterns. The assistant will analyze questions, decide whether to use tools, execute those tools when needed, and provide helpful responses. Throughout this process, LangSmith will capture detailed traces that show every decision point, timing data, and the flow of information through the system."

    "## Prerequisites and Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin building, we need to set up our development environment. This involves installing the necessary packages and configuring API keys for both OpenAI (which powers our AI) and LangSmith (which provides observability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this setup is crucial because LangSmith works by automatically intercepting and logging all LangGraph operations. Once configured, every LLM call, tool execution, and workflow step will be captured without requiring additional code changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Python 3.9+ \n",
    "- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))\n",
    "- LangSmith account ([free signup](https://smith.langchain.com)) - This provides the observability dashboard where you'll see all the insights"

    "Now we'll configure the API keys and enable LangSmith tracing. The key insight here is that setting `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` automatically enables comprehensive logging of all operations. Think of this as installing a \"flight recorder\" for your AI system. From this point forward, every decision and operation will be captured and made visible in your LangSmith dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fundamentally different from traditional logging because LangSmith understands the structure of AI workflows. Instead of just capturing text logs, it builds a complete picture of how information flows through your system."

    "**Trace List View**: You'll see a list of all your test executions. Each row represents one complete run of your agent, showing the input question, execution time, success/failure status, and total cost. This view gives you a high-level overview of system performance across different types of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local image](./assets/1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as your system's activity log, but with much richer information than traditional logs. You can sort by execution time to find slow queries, filter by tags to analyze specific types of questions, or look for patterns in cost per query.\n",

    "![Local image](./assets/2.png)\n",
    "**Graph Visualization**: A visual representation of your workflow showing which nodes were executed and how data flowed between them. This is particularly powerful because you can see at a glance whether search was used and how long each step took.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step Execution**: Each function call with inputs, outputs, and timing. This granular view helps you understand not just what happened, but why it happened. You can see the exact prompts sent to the language model and the reasoning it provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Local image](./assets/3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Calls**: Every prompt sent to the language model with the exact response. This transparency is crucial for prompt optimization and understanding model behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Performance Analytics**: LangSmith automatically aggregates performance data across all your runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency Patterns**: Which steps consistently take the longest? Is search always the bottleneck, or does decision-making sometimes slow things down?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Analysis**: How much does each type of query cost? Are search queries significantly more expensive than direct answers?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Rates**: Are there categories of queries that consistently fail? Do certain question patterns lead to search errors?\n",

    "## Key Observability Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the traces you've just generated, here are the types of insights LangSmith enables. These insights transform how you understand and improve AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision-Making Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question, you can see exactly why the agent chose to search or answer directly. This transparency is crucial for debugging unexpected behavior and building trust in AI systems. When users ask why the system behaved a certain way, you can point to specific reasoning captured in the traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing execution times across different question types, you can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. For example, you might discover that search queries take significantly longer than direct answers, suggesting opportunities for caching or parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Management\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith shows you the token usage and estimated cost for each LLM call. This granular cost data helps you optimize in ways that would be impossible without observability. You can identify expensive operations and optimize prompts or routing logic to reduce costs without sacrificing quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Assurance\n",
    "\n",
    "With complete traces, you can verify that the agent is making reasonable decisions consistently. You can spot patterns in successful versus failed executions, identify edge cases that need additional handling, and create regression tests based on real usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic approach to quality assurance is only possible with comprehensive observability."

    "**Start with observability from day one**: Enable LangSmith tracing before building complex features. \n",
