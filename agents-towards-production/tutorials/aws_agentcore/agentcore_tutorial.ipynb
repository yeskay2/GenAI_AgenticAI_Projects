        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial introduces AWS Bedrock AgentCore, a runtime framework designed to transform local AI agents into production-ready systems. We will walk through the process of creating a simple agent and then wrapping it with AgentCore to enable managed execution, request tracking, and standardized communication patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how AgentCore serves as an infrastructure layer that sits between your agent logic and the production environment, handling the complexities of request management, execution control, and runtime orchestration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What You Will Learn\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial covers three fundamental concepts. First, you will learn how to build a basic agent using standard Python. Second, you will understand how to wrap your agent with the AgentCore runtime using the Python SDK. Finally, you will see how to run your agent locally through a standardized HTTP interface that provides request tracking and structured responses.\n"

        "## Understanding AgentCore Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into implementation, it helps to understand what AgentCore does and why it matters. When you build an agent locally, it typically exists as a Python function or class that takes input and returns output. This works fine for development and testing, but production environments require additional infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "AgentCore provides this infrastructure layer. Think of it as a control tower for your agent. The control tower does not fly the plane, but it manages takeoffs, landings, and communications. Similarly, AgentCore does not change your agent's logic, but it manages how requests reach your agent, how responses are returned, and how the entire execution is tracked and monitored.\n",
        "\n",
        "The framework introduces several key components. The runtime server handles incoming requests and routes them to your agent. The SDK provides a simple decorator pattern to convert your function into an HTTP service. Together, these components create a managed execution environment that transforms a local function into a production service.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use AgentCore\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary value of AgentCore lies in separation of concerns. Your agent code focuses purely on processing messages and generating responses. AgentCore handles everything else: accepting HTTP requests, validating input, tracking execution time, managing errors, and formatting responses. This separation makes your code cleaner, easier to test, and simpler to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, AgentCore provides a foundation for production capabilities. Once your agent runs through the runtime, you can add tools, enable logging, implement access control, and deploy to any server without modifying your core agent logic. The infrastructure grows around your agent, not inside it."

You can deploy your agent to AWS using the AgentCore starter toolkit where it handles real user requests.\n",
