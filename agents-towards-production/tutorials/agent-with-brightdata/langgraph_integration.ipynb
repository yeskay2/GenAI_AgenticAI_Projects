            "\n",
            "The agent follows a systematic approach when processing user queries:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Initial Analysis Phase:** The agent examines the user's question to determine the type of information required, whether current or real-time data is necessary, and how specific or broad the search scope should be.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tool Selection Logic:** Based on the analysis, the agent decides whether to use the search tool. This decision depends on factors such as whether the query requires current information beyond the model's training data, if the question involves specific factual claims that need verification, and how detailed the information request is.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Search Strategy Formation:** When search is determined to be necessary, the agent formulates appropriate search terms and parameters. This involves extracting key concepts from the user query, determining optimal search term combinations, and selecting appropriate search parameters.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Result Synthesis:** After receiving search results, the agent analyzes information from multiple sources, synthesizes findings into coherent insights, provides structured and relevant answers, and cites sources when appropriate.\n",
