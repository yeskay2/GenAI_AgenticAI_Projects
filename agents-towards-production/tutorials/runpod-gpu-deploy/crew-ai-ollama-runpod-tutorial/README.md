# CrewAI + Ollama on RunPod: Serverless AI Agents

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to deploy an AI agent system on [RunPod](https://get.runpod.io/nirdiamant)'s serverless infrastructure. The sample application creates an API endpoint that generates blog posts on any topic through an AI agent workflow.

Key components:
- **CrewAI**: Framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents
- **Ollama**: Tool for running open-source LLMs locally
- **RunPod**: Serverless GPU infrastructure for AI deployment

*Referenced from: [RunPod Worker Template](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-template)*

## RunPod Template

Get started immediately using our pre-configured RunPod template:

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/RunPod-Deploy%20Now-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=none" alt="Deploy on RunPod" width="200"/>](https://get.runpod.io/nirdiamant)

## How It Works

This application:
1. Exposes an API endpoint through RunPod
2. Accepts a topic as input
3. Uses CrewAI to manage an AI agent that:
   - Researches the topic (using a mock research tool in this example)
   - Writes a structured blog post
4. Returns the generated blog post as JSON

## Architecture

- **Handler Function**: Entry point that processes requests (handler.py)
- **Blog Writer Agent**: AI agent configured for content creation
- **Mock Research Tool**: Simulates research by providing predefined facts
- **Docker Container**: Packages everything with Ollama for serverless deployment

## Getting Started

### Deployment to RunPod

#### Option 1: Use RunPod Template (Recommended)

1. Click the "Deploy on RunPod" button above
2. Configure your endpoint settings
3. Deploy and start using immediately

#### Option 2: Build and Deploy Custom Image

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t yourusername/crew-ai-ollama:latest . --platform linux/amd64
   docker push yourusername/crew-ai-ollama:latest
   ```

2. Create a new Serverless Endpoint on RunPod
3. Select "Docker Image" as the source
4. Enter your image URL
5. Configure hardware settings (recommended: GPU with 24GB+ VRAM)
6. Set worker count (min: 0, max: based on expected traffic)
7. Deploy your endpoint

## Usage

### API Endpoint

Once deployed, your RunPod endpoint will provide a URL in this format:
```
https://api.runpod.ai/v2/[ENDPOINT_ID]/run
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.runpod.ai/v2/[ENDPOINT_ID]/run \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header "authorization: [YOUR_API_KEY]" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data '
{
  "input": {
    "topic": "artificial intelligence"
  }
}
'
```

## Key Files

### handler.py

The main entry point for processing requests:

```python
import runpod
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM
from crewai.tools import tool
import os

# Configure Ollama LLM
llm = LLM(model="ollama/openhermes", base_url="http://localhost:11434")

# Create a pseudo-research tool that returns fake information
@tool("Research Tool")
def fake_research(topic: str) -> str:
    """
    Pretends to search for information about a topic. 
    Will always return some fake pre-defined content.
    """
    # ... returns fake research data
    
# Create blog writer agent
blog_writer = Agent(
    role="Blog Writer",
    goal="Write engaging and informative blog posts on various topics",
    backstory="You are a professional blog writer...",
    tools=[fake_research],
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm
)

def create_blog_post(topic):
    """Creates a blog post on the given topic using CrewAI"""
    # ... creates and executes the task

def handler(job):
    """Handler function that will be used to process jobs."""
    job_input = job["input"]
    topic = job_input.get("topic", "technology")
    
    try:
        blog_post = create_blog_post(topic)
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "blog_post": blog_post
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "message": str(e)
        }

runpod.serverless.start({"handler": handler})
```

### Dockerfile

Contains the configuration for creating a containerized version of the application:

```Dockerfile
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.0.1-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install uv && \
    uv pip install --upgrade -r /requirements.txt --no-cache-dir && \
    uv pip install "langchain-community>=0.0.34" --no-cache-dir

# Download model during build
RUN ollama serve > /dev/null 2>&1 & \
    sleep 25 && \
    ollama pull openhermes && \
    sleep 10 && \
    pkill ollama

# Startup script
CMD ["/start.sh"]
```

## Performance Considerations

- The first request may experience cold-start latency as the container initializes
- Pre-loading the Ollama model in the Docker image significantly improves response time
- Response times typically range from 5-15 seconds depending on the complexity of the topic

## Extending This Project

This template can be extended in several ways:
- Replace the mock research tool with real web search functionality
- Add more specialized agents for different aspects of content creation
- Implement more complex workflows with multiple agents collaborating
- Fine-tune the LLM for your specific use case
