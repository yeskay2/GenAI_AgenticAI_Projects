# 🚀 Multi-User Agent Tutorial with Arcade.dev

## Overview

Build AI agents that actually work in production with multiple users. Learn to implement secure authentication, safety controls, and real service integration using Arcade.dev - bridging the gap between local demos and production-ready systems.


## What You'll Learn

- **Multi-User Authentication**: Set up OAuth2 flows for Gmail, Slack, and Notion
- **Production Architecture**: Build agents that scale beyond single-user demos
- **Safety Controls**: Add human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive operations
- **Real Service Integration**: Connect agents to external APIs with proper authentication
- **Security Best Practices**: Implement production-ready security measures

## Tutorial

### **[Complete Tutorial: multiuser-agent-arcade.ipynb](./multiuser-agent-arcade.ipynb)**
Build progressively sophisticated agents:
1. **Basic Chat Agent** - Simple conversational AI using LangGraph
2. **Tool-Enabled Agent** - AI that securely accesses external APIs
3. **Production Agent** - Full system with safety controls and multi-service coordination

## Tech Stack

- **LangGraph** - Agent orchestration and state management
- **Arcade.dev** - Authentication and secure API access
- **OAuth2** - Secure user authorization

## Who This Is For

Developers who want to build AI agents that work in the real world with multiple users, not just cool demos.
