# ⏩ Sequential Agent Workflows wit GitHub Models (.NET)

## 📋 Advanced Sequential Processing Tutorial

Dis notebook dey show **sequential workflow patterns** wey dey use Microsoft Agent Framework for .NET and GitHub Models. You go learn how to build beta, step-by-step processing pipelines wey agents go dey run one after the other, and each stage go dey use wetin the previous stage don do.

## 🎯 Wetin You Go Learn

### 🔄 **Sequential Processing Architecture**
- **Linear Workflow Design**: Create step-by-step processing pipelines wey get clear connection
- **State Management**: Keep context and data flow across all the workflow stages
- **GitHub Models Integration**: Use GitHub AI models for multi-stage .NET workflows
- **Enterprise Pipeline Patterns**: Build production-ready sequential processing systems

### 🏗️ **Advanced Sequential Patterns**
- **Stage-Gate Processing**: Put validation checkpoints between workflow stages
- **Context Preservation**: Keep state and all the knowledge wey don gather across all stages
- **Error Propagation**: Manage errors well well for sequential processing chains
- **Performance Optimization**: Make sure sequential execution dey fast and no dey waste resources

### 🏢 **Enterprise Sequential Applications**
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Multi-stage document analysis, transformation, and validation
- **Quality Assurance Workflows**: Sequential review, validation, and approval processes
- **Content Production Pipeline**: Research → Writing → Editing → Review → Publishing
- **Business Process Automation**: Multi-step business workflows wey get clear stage connection

## ⚙️ Wetin You Need & Setup

### 📦 **NuGet Packages We You Go Need**

Important packages for .NET sequential workflows:

```xml
<!-- Core AI Framework -->
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.AI" Version="9.9.0" />

<!-- Client Model Abstractions -->
<PackageReference Include="System.ClientModel" Version="1.6.1.0" />

<!-- Azure Identity and Async LINQ Support -->
<PackageReference Include="Azure.Identity" Version="1.15.0" />
<PackageReference Include="System.Linq.Async" Version="6.0.3" />

<!-- Local Agent Framework References -->
<!-- Microsoft.Agents.AI.dll - Core agent abstractions -->
<!-- Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI.dll - GitHub Models integration -->
```

### 🔑 **GitHub Models Configuration**

**Environment Setup (.env file):**
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_ENDPOINT=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com
GITHUB_MODEL_ID=gpt-4o-mini
```

**Configuration Management:**
```csharp
// Load environment variables securely
Env.Load("../../../.env");
var githubToken = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN");
var githubEndpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_ENDPOINT");
var modelId = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_MODEL_ID");
```

### 🏗️ **Sequential Workflow Architecture**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Input] --> B[Stage 1: Analysis Agent]
    B --> C[Checkpoint 1]
    C --> D[Stage 2: Processing Agent]
    D --> E[Checkpoint 2]
    E --> F[Stage 3: Validation Agent]
    F --> G[Final Output]
    
    H[State Context] --> B
    H --> D
    H --> F
    
    I[GitHub Models API] --> B
    I --> D
    I --> F
```

**Key Components:**
- **Sequential Agents**: Special agents for each processing stage
- **State Context**: Keep all the data and decisions wey don gather across stages
- **Checkpoints**: Validation points between stages to make sure say everything dey okay
- **GitHub Models Client**: Steady AI model access across all workflow stages

## 🎨 **Sequential Workflow Design Patterns**

### 📝 **Document Processing Pipeline**
```
Raw Document → Content Extraction → Analysis → Validation → Structured Output
```

### 🎯 **Content Creation Workflow**
```
Brief/Requirements → Research → Content Creation → Review → Final Polish
```

### 🔍 **Quality Assurance Pipeline**
```
Initial Review → Technical Validation → Compliance Check → Final Approval
```

### 💼 **Business Intelligence Workflow**
```
Data Collection → Processing → Analysis → Report Generation → Distribution
```

## 🏢 **Enterprise Sequential Benefits**

### 🎯 **Reliability & Quality**
- **Deterministic Processing**: Steady, repeatable results through structured stages
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints dey make sure say quality dey for each stage
- **Error Isolation**: If one stage get problem, e no go affect the next stage
- **Audit Trails**: Full tracking of all decisions and changes for each stage

### 📈 **Scalability & Performance**
- **Modular Design**: You fit optimize each stage one by one
- **Resource Management**: Use AI model resources well across stages
- **State Optimization**: Transfer small small state between stages to make performance better
- **Parallel Stage Groups**: Run many sequential workflows at the same time

### 🔒 **Security & Compliance**
- **Stage-Level Security**: Different security rules for different processing stages
- **Data Validation**: Make sure data dey correct and follow rules for each checkpoint
- **Access Control**: Give permission for different workflow stages
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Follow all the rules wey government put through structured processing

### 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics**
- **Stage-Level Metrics**: Check performance for each workflow stage
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find and fix slow stages
- **Quality Metrics**: Track quality and success for each stage
- **Process Optimization**: Improve workflow based on stage-level analytics

Make we build strong sequential AI processing pipelines! 🚀

## 💻 How to Run the Code

The full implementation dey for `02.dotnet-agent-framework-workflow-ghmodel-sequential.cs`. Dis file dey show **three-stage furniture analysis workflow**:

1. **Stage 1 - Sales Agent**: E go check furniture images and give buying suggestions
2. **Stage 2 - Price Agent**: E go give detailed pricing breakdowns and budget options
3. **Stage 3 - Quote Agent**: E go create professional quote document for Markdown format

### 🏗️ **Workflow Architecture**

```
Image Input → Sales Analysis → Price Estimation → Quote Generation → Final Output
```

Each agent:
- E go use wetin the previous stage don do as context
- E go add e own analysis based on e expertise
- E go keep workflow continuity through state management

### 🚀 How to Run the Example

**Wetin You Need:**
- Put furniture image for `../imgs/home.png` (or change the `imgPath` variable)
- Set your `.env` file with GitHub Models credentials

```bash
# Make the script executable (Unix/Linux/macOS)
chmod +x 02.dotnet-agent-framework-workflow-ghmodel-sequential.cs

# Run the sequential workflow
./02.dotnet-agent-framework-workflow-ghmodel-sequential.cs
```

Or for Windows:
```powershell
dotnet run 02.dotnet-agent-framework-workflow-ghmodel-sequential.cs
```

### 📝 Wetin You Go See for Output

The workflow go:
1. **Sales Agent**: Identify furniture items from the image and give recommendations
2. **Price Agent**: Add detailed pricing analysis with budget tiers and shopping suggestions
3. **Quote Agent**: Create formatted quote document wey go join all the information together

The final output go be complete, professional furniture quote based on image analysis.

### 🔧 How You Fit Customize

**Change Agent Behavior:**
```csharp
// Adjust agent instructions to change their focus
const string SalesAgentInstructions = "Your custom instructions...";
```

**Change Sequential Flow:**
```csharp
// Add or reorder workflow stages
var workflow = new WorkflowBuilder(salesagent)
    .AddEdge(salesagent, priceagent)
    .AddEdge(priceagent, quoteagent)
    .AddEdge(quoteagent, newAgent)  // Add another stage
    .Build();
```

**Use Different Input:**
```csharp
// Process text instead of images
ChatMessage userMessage = new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, [
    new TextContent("Analyze pricing for a modern living room set")
]);
```

### 🎯 Real-World Applications

Dis sequential pattern dey good for:
- **E-commerce**: Product analysis → Pricing → Quote generation
- **Real Estate**: Property analysis → Valuation → Listing creation
- **Insurance**: Claim analysis → Assessment → Quote generation
- **Content Creation**: Research → Writing → Editing → Publishing

### 🔍 How State Flow Work

Each agent for the sequence go get:
- **Original Input**: The first user message (image + text)
- **Previous Agent Outputs**: All the response wey the agents don give before
- **Accumulated Context**: Full state wey don dey keep since the workflow start

Dis one dey make multi-stage processing beta because each agent go dey use all the context wey don gather from the previous stages.
