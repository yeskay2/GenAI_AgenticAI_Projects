## Understanding Microsoft Agent Framework

![Framework Intro](../../../translated_images/en/framework-intro.077af16617cf130c.webp)

[Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/agent-framewrok) builds on the experience and insights gained from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen. It provides the flexibility to address a wide range of agent-based use cases in both production and research environments, including:

- **Sequential Agent Orchestration** for scenarios requiring step-by-step workflows.
- **Concurrent Orchestration** for scenarios where agents need to perform tasks simultaneously.
- **Group Chat Orchestration** for scenarios where agents collaborate on a single task.
- **Handoff Orchestration** for scenarios where agents pass tasks to one another as subtasks are completed.
- **Magnetic Orchestration** for scenarios where a manager agent creates and modifies task lists and coordinates subagents to complete tasks.

To deliver AI agents in production, MAF includes features for:

- **Observability** using OpenTelemetry, which tracks every action of the AI agent, including tool usage, orchestration steps, reasoning flows, and performance monitoring via Azure AI Foundry dashboards.
- **Security** by hosting agents natively on Azure AI Foundry, which includes security controls like role-based access, private data handling, and built-in content safety.
- **Durability** allowing agent threads and workflows to pause, resume, and recover from errors, enabling long-running processes.
- **Control** supporting human-in-the-loop workflows where tasks require human approval.

Microsoft Agent Framework is also designed to be interoperable by:

- **Being Cloud-Agnostic** - Agents can run in containers, on-premises, and across multiple clouds.
- **Being Provider-Agnostic** - Agents can be created using your preferred SDK, including Azure OpenAI and OpenAI.
- **Integrating Open Standards** - Agents can use protocols like Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to discover and utilize other agents and tools.
- **Plugins and Connectors** - Connections can be made to data and memory services like Microsoft Fabric, SharePoint, Pinecone, and Qdrant.

Let’s explore how these features apply to the core concepts of Microsoft Agent Framework.

## Key Concepts of Microsoft Agent Framework

### Agents

![Agent Framework](../../../translated_images/en/agent-components.410a06daf87b4fef.webp)

**Creating Agents**

Agents are created by defining the inference service (LLM provider), a set of instructions for the AI agent to follow, and an assigned `name`:

```python
agent = AzureOpenAIChatClient(credential=AzureCliCredential()).create_agent( instructions="You are good at recommending trips to customers based on their preferences.", name="TripRecommender" )
```

The example above uses `Azure OpenAI`, but agents can also be created using services like `Azure AI Foundry Agent Service`:

```python
AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential).create_agent( name="HelperAgent", instructions="You are a helpful assistant." ) as agent
```

OpenAI `Responses`, `ChatCompletion` APIs

```python
agent = OpenAIResponsesClient().create_agent( name="WeatherBot", instructions="You are a helpful weather assistant.", )
```

```python
agent = OpenAIChatClient().create_agent( name="HelpfulAssistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.", )
```

or remote agents using the A2A protocol:

```python
agent = A2AAgent( name=agent_card.name, description=agent_card.description, agent_card=agent_card, url="https://your-a2a-agent-host" )
```

**Running Agents**

Agents are executed using the `.run` or `.run_stream` methods for non-streaming or streaming responses.

```python
result = await agent.run("What are good places to visit in Amsterdam?")
print(result.text)
```

```python
async for update in agent.run_stream("What are the good places to visit in Amsterdam?"):
    if update.text:
        print(update.text, end="", flush=True)

```

Each agent run can be customized with options like `max_tokens` used by the agent, `tools` the agent can call, and even the `model` itself. 

This is useful for scenarios requiring specific models or tools to complete a user’s task.

**Tools**

Tools can be defined both during agent creation:

```python
def get_attractions( location: Annotated[str, Field(description="The location to get the top tourist attractions for")], ) -> str: """Get the top tourist attractions for a given location.""" return f"The top attractions for {location} are." 


# When creating a ChatAgent directly 

agent = ChatAgent( chat_client=OpenAIChatClient(), instructions="You are a helpful assistant", tools=[get_attractions]

```

and while running the agent:

```python

result1 = await agent.run( "What's the best place to visit in Seattle?", tools=[get_attractions] # Tool provided for this run only )
```

**Agent Threads**

Agent threads handle multi-turn conversations. Threads can be created by:

- Using `get_new_thread()`, which allows the thread to be saved over time.
- Automatically creating a thread during agent execution, with the thread lasting only for the current run.

To create a thread, the code looks like this:

```python
# Create a new thread. 
thread = agent.get_new_thread() # Run the agent with the thread. 
response = await agent.run("Hello, I am here to help you book travel. Where would you like to go?", thread=thread)

```

Threads can then be serialized for later use:

```python
# Create a new thread. 
thread = agent.get_new_thread() 

# Run the agent with the thread. 

response = await agent.run("Hello, how are you?", thread=thread) 

# Serialize the thread for storage. 

serialized_thread = await thread.serialize() 

# Deserialize the thread state after loading from storage. 

resumed_thread = await agent.deserialize_thread(serialized_thread)
```

**Agent Middleware**

Agents interact with tools and LLMs to complete user tasks. In certain scenarios, actions or tracking are needed between these interactions. Agent middleware enables this through:

*Function Middleware*

This middleware executes actions between the agent and a function/tool it calls. For example, it can log function calls.

In the code below, `next` determines whether the next middleware or the actual function should be called.

```python
async def logging_function_middleware(
    context: FunctionInvocationContext,
    next: Callable[[FunctionInvocationContext], Awaitable[None]],
) -> None:
    """Function middleware that logs function execution."""
    # Pre-processing: Log before function execution
    print(f"[Function] Calling {context.function.name}")

    # Continue to next middleware or function execution
    await next(context)

    # Post-processing: Log after function execution
    print(f"[Function] {context.function.name} completed")
```

*Chat Middleware*

This middleware executes or logs actions between the agent and requests sent to the LLM.

It includes important information like the `messages` sent to the AI service.

```python
async def logging_chat_middleware(
    context: ChatContext,
    next: Callable[[ChatContext], Awaitable[None]],
) -> None:
    """Chat middleware that logs AI interactions."""
    # Pre-processing: Log before AI call
    print(f"[Chat] Sending {len(context.messages)} messages to AI")

    # Continue to next middleware or AI service
    await next(context)

    # Post-processing: Log after AI response
    print("[Chat] AI response received")

```

**Agent Memory**

As covered in the `Agentic Memory` lesson, memory is crucial for enabling agents to operate across different contexts. MAF offers several types of memory:

*In-Memory Storage*

Memory stored in threads during application runtime.

```python
# Create a new thread. 
thread = agent.get_new_thread() # Run the agent with the thread. 
response = await agent.run("Hello, I am here to help you book travel. Where would you like to go?", thread=thread)
```

*Persistent Messages*

Memory used to store conversation history across sessions, defined using the `chat_message_store_factory`:

```python
from agent_framework import ChatMessageStore

# Create a custom message store
def create_message_store():
    return ChatMessageStore()

agent = ChatAgent(
    chat_client=OpenAIChatClient(),
    instructions="You are a Travel assistant.",
    chat_message_store_factory=create_message_store
)

```

*Dynamic Memory*

Memory added to the context before agents are run. These memories can be stored in external services like mem0:

```python
from agent_framework.mem0 import Mem0Provider

# Using Mem0 for advanced memory capabilities
memory_provider = Mem0Provider(
    api_key="your-mem0-api-key",
    user_id="user_123",
    application_id="my_app"
)

agent = ChatAgent(
    chat_client=OpenAIChatClient(),
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant with memory.",
    context_providers=memory_provider
)

```

**Agent Observability**

Observability is key to building reliable and maintainable agent systems. MAF integrates with OpenTelemetry to provide tracing and metrics for better observability.

```python
from agent_framework.observability import get_tracer, get_meter

tracer = get_tracer()
meter = get_meter()
with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_custom_span"):
    # do something
    pass
counter = meter.create_counter("my_custom_counter")
counter.add(1, {"key": "value"})
```

### Workflows

MAF provides workflows with pre-defined steps to complete tasks, incorporating AI agents as components in those steps.

Workflows consist of components that allow better control flow. They also enable **multi-agent orchestration** and **checkpointing** to save workflow states.

The core components of a workflow are:

**Executors**

Executors receive input messages, perform their assigned tasks, and produce output messages, advancing the workflow toward completing the larger task. Executors can be AI agents or custom logic.

**Edges**

Edges define the flow of messages in a workflow. Types include:

*Direct Edges* - Simple one-to-one connections between executors:

```python
from agent_framework import WorkflowBuilder

builder = WorkflowBuilder()
builder.add_edge(source_executor, target_executor)
builder.set_start_executor(source_executor)
workflow = builder.build()
```

*Conditional Edges* - Activated when certain conditions are met. For example, suggesting alternatives when hotel rooms are unavailable.

*Switch-case Edges* - Route messages to different executors based on defined conditions. For example, handling priority customers through a separate workflow.

*Fan-out Edges* - Send one message to multiple targets.

*Fan-in Edges* - Collect multiple messages from different executors and send them to one target.

**Events**

To enhance workflow observability, MAF provides built-in events for execution, including:

- `WorkflowStartedEvent` - Workflow execution begins
- `WorkflowOutputEvent` - Workflow produces an output
- `WorkflowErrorEvent` - Workflow encounters an error
- `ExecutorInvokeEvent` - Executor starts processing
- `ExecutorCompleteEvent` - Executor finishes processing
- `RequestInfoEvent` - A request is issued

## Migrating From Other Frameworks (Semantic Kernel and AutoGen)

### Differences between MAF and Semantic Kernel

**Simplified Agent Creation**

Semantic Kernel requires creating a Kernel instance for every agent. MAF simplifies this by using extensions for main providers.

```python
agent = AzureOpenAIChatClient(credential=AzureCliCredential()).create_agent( instructions="You are good at reccomending trips to customers based on their preferences.", name="TripRecommender" )
```

**Agent Thread Creation**

Semantic Kernel requires manual thread creation. In MAF, threads are directly assigned to agents.

```python
thread = agent.get_new_thread() # Run the agent with the thread. 
```

**Tool Registration**

In Semantic Kernel, tools are registered to the Kernel, which is then passed to the agent. In MAF, tools are registered directly during agent creation.

```python
agent = ChatAgent( chat_client=OpenAIChatClient(), instructions="You are a helpful assistant", tools=[get_attractions]
```

### Differences between MAF and AutoGen

**Teams vs Workflows**

AutoGen uses `Teams` for event-driven activity with agents. MAF uses `Workflows`, which route data to executors through a graph-based architecture.

**Tool Creation**

AutoGen uses `FunctionTool` to wrap functions for agents to call. MAF uses @ai_function, which operates similarly but also automatically infers schemas for each function.

**Agent Behavior**

Agents in AutoGen are single-turn by default unless `max_tool_iterations` is set higher. In MAF, the `ChatAgent` is multi-turn by default, meaning it continues calling tools until the user’s task is complete.
