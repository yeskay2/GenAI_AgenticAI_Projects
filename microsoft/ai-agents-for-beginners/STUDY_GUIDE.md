# AI Agents for Beginners - Study Guide & Course Summary

This guide provides a summary of the "AI Agents for Beginners" course and explains key concepts, frameworks, and design patterns for building AI Agents.

## 1. Introduction to AI Agents

**What are AI Agents?**
AI Agents are systems that extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by giving them access to **tools**, **knowledge**, and **memory**. Unlike a standard LLM chatbot that only generates text based on training data, an AI Agent can:
- **Perceive** its environment (via sensors or inputs).
- **Reason** about how to solve a problem.
- **Act** to change the environment (via actuators or tool execution).

**Key Components of an Agent:**
- **Environment**: The space where the agent operates (e.g., a booking system).
- **Sensors**: Mechanisms to gather information (e.g., reading an API).
- **Actuators**: Mechanisms to perform actions (e.g., sending an email).
- **Brain (LLM)**: The reasoning engine that plans and decides which actions to take.

## 2. Agentic Frameworks

The course uses **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** with **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service V2** for building agents:

| Component | Focus | Best For |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Microsoft Agent Framework** | Unified Python/C# SDK for agents, tools, and workflows | Building agents with tools, multi-agent workflows, and production patterns. |
| **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** | Managed cloud runtime | Secure, scalable deployment with built-in state management, observability, and trust. |

## 3. Agentic Design Patterns

Design patterns help structure how agents operate to solve problems reliably.

### **Tool Use Pattern** (Lesson 4)
This pattern enables agents to interact with the outside world.
- **Concept**: The agent is provided with a "schema" (a list of available functions and their parameters). The LLM decides *which* tool to call and with *what* arguments based on the user's request.
- **Flow**: User Request -> LLM -> **Tool Selection** -> **Tool Execution** -> LLM (with tool output) -> Final Response.
- **Use Cases**: Retrieving real-time data (weather, stock prices), performing calculations, executing code.

### **Planning Pattern** (Lesson 7)
This pattern enables agents to solve complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Concept**: The agent breaks down a high-level goal into a sequence of smaller subtasks.
- **Approaches**:
  - **Task Decomposition**: Splitting "Plan a trip" into "Book flight", "Book hotel", "Rent car".
  - **Iterative Planning**: Re-evaluating the plan based on the output of previous steps (e.g., if the flight is full, choose a different date).
- **Implementation**: Often involves a "Planner" agent that generates a structured plan (e.g., JSON) which is then executed by other agents.

## 4. Design Principles

When designing agents, consider three dimensions:
- **Space**: Agents should connect people and knowledge, be accessible but unobtrusive.
- **Time**: Agents should learn from the *Past*, provide relevant nudges in the *Now*, and adapt for the *Future*.
- **Core**: Embrace uncertainty but establish trust through transparency and user control.

## 5. Summary of Key Lessons

- **Lesson 1**: Agents are systems, not just models. They perceive, reason, and act.
- **Lesson 2**: Microsoft Agent Framework abstracts the complexity of tool calling and state management.
- **Lesson 3**: Design with transparency and user control in mind.
- **Lesson 4**: Tools are the "hands" of the agent. Schema definition is crucial for the LLM to understand how to use them.
- **Lesson 7**: Planning is the "executive function" of the agent, enabling it to tackle complex workflows.
